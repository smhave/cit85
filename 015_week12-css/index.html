<h1>1</h1>

<p class="red" id="blue">The class "red" has a specificity of 10, while the ID "blue" has a specificity of 100, so the blue ID wins.</p>

<h1>2</h1>

<h4 id="green">The "yellow" h4 element selector has a specificity of 1, and the "green" ID has a specificity of 100, so the yellow ID wins.</h4>

<h1>3</h1>

<h4 class="red">The "red" class has a specificity of 10, while the "yellow" h4 element selector has a specificity of 1, so the red class wins.</h4>

<h1>4</h1>

<h5 font-size="16px">The "blue" attribute font-size 16 selector has a specificity of 10, while the "red" h5 element selector has a specificity of 1, so the blue attribute selector wins.</h5>

<h1>5</h1>

<em class="red" font-size="16px">Both the blue font-size 16 attribute selector and the red class have a specificity of 10, but the attribute selector ended up winning. I believe this is because the font-size 16 attribute selector is listed later in the CSS than the red class.</em>
